# Pre-Atomization of XName Objects (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)

One way to improve performance in LINQ to XML is to pre-atomize <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects. Pre-atomization means that you assign a string to an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> object before you create the XML tree by using the constructors of the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> classes. Then, instead of passing a string to the constructor, which would use the implicit conversion from string to <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName>, you pass the initialized <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> object.

This improves performance when you create a large XML tree in which specific names are repeated. To do this, you declare and initialize <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects before you construct the XML tree, and then use the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects instead of specifying strings for the element and attribute names. This technique can yield significant performance gains if you are creating a large number of elements (or attributes) with the same name.

You should test pre-atomization with your scenario to decide if you should use it.

## Example

The following example demonstrates this:

```vb
Dim root1 As XName = "Root"
Dim data As XName = "Data"
Dim id As XName = "ID"

Dim root2 As New XElement(root1, New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "1"), "4,100,000"),
                          New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "2"), "3,700,000"),
                          New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "3"), "1,150,000"))

Console.WriteLine(root2)
```

This example produces the following output:

```xml
<Root>
  <Data ID="1">4,100,000</Data>
  <Data ID="2">3,700,000</Data>
  <Data ID="3">1,150,000</Data>
</Root>
```

The following example shows the same technique where the XML document is in a namespace:

```vb
Dim aw As XNamespace = "http://www.adventure-works.com"
Dim root1 As XName = aw + "Root"
Dim data As XName = aw + "Data"
Dim id As XName = "ID"

Dim root2 As New XElement(root1, New XAttribute(XNamespace.Xmlns + "aw", aw),
                          New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "1"), "4,100,000"),
                          New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "2"), "3,700,000"),
                          New XElement(data, New XAttribute(id, "3"), "1,150,000"))

Console.WriteLine(root2)
```

This example produces the following output:

```xml
<aw:Root xmlns:aw="http://www.adventure-works.com">
  <aw:Data ID="1">4,100,000</aw:Data>
  <aw:Data ID="2">3,700,000</aw:Data>
  <aw:Data ID="3">1,150,000</aw:Data>
</aw:Root>
```

The following example is more similar to what you will likely encounter in the real world. In this example, the content of the element is supplied by a query:

```vb
Dim root1 As XName = "Root"
Dim data As XName = "Data"
Dim id As XName = "ID"
  
Dim sw As Stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew()
Dim root2 As New XElement(root1, From i In Enumerable.Range(1, 100000)
                                 Select New XElement(data, New XAttribute(ID, i), i * 5))
sw.Stop()
Console.WriteLine($"Time to construct: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} milliseconds")
```  

The previous example performs better than the following example, in which names are not pre-atomized:

```vb
Dim sw As Stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew()
Dim root As New XElement("Root", From i In Enumerable.Range(1, 100000)
                                 Select New XElement("Data", New XAttribute("ID", i), i * 5))
sw.Stop()
Console.WriteLine($"Time to construct: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} milliseconds")
```
